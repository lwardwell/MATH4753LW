\title{My Bayes Function}
\usage{
mybayes(x, y, z)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric. The probability of a true positive, P(+|U), where + indicates a positive test result
and U indicates the condition being present.}

\item{y}{Numeric. The prior probability, P(U), representing the probability of the condition being present.}

\item{z}{Numeric. The probability of a false positive, P(+|NU), where + indicates a positive test result
and NU indicates the condition being absent.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The posterior probability P(U|+), which is the probability that the condition is absent
        given a positive test result.
}
\description{
Calculates the posterior probability using Bayes' theorem for a specific scenario,
typically used in diagnostic or classification contexts.
}
\examples{
# Calculate posterior probability with 90\% true positive rate,
# 5\% prevalence, and 10\% false positive rate
mybayes(0.9, 0.05, 0.1)

# For a medical test with 95\% sensitivity, 1\% disease prevalence,
# and 8\% false positive rate
mybayes(0.95, 0.01, 0.08)
