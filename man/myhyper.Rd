\title{Hypergeometric Distribution Simulation}
\usage{
myhyper(iter = 100, N = 20, r = 12, n = 5)
}
\arguments{
\item{iter}{Integer. The number of iterations (samples) to simulate. Default is `100`.}

\item{N}{Integer. The total population size. Default is `20`.}

\item{r}{Integer. The number of "successes" in the population. Default is `12`.}

\item{n}{Integer. The sample size for each iteration. Default is `5`.}
}
\value{
A table of proportions for each possible number of successes.
Additionally, a bar plot of the proportions is displayed.
}
\description{
This function simulates random samples from a **hypergeometric distribution**
and creates a bar plot of the resulting proportions.
}
\examples{
# Simulate 100 samples with default parameters
myhyper()

# Simulate 500 samples with a larger population
myhyper(iter = 500, N = 50, r = 30, n = 10)

# Simulate 200 samples with different success probability
myhyper(iter = 200, N = 25, r = 5, n = 7)
}
